# meta-messages-sentiment-analysis
This mini project proposes utilizing a pull request of my personal data from Facebook/Instagram to perform sentiment analysis with the hope of recognizing trends. The code should be replicable as long as you have your own pulls from Facebook/Instagram, and are willing to modify directories as needed.

I performing the analysis directly in Jupyter Notebooks.
